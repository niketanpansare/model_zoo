# Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and by community contributors. Yangqing Jia created the project during his PhD at UC Berkeley. Caffe is released under the BSD 2-Clause license. (Source: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)

# Creating Caffe models

  1. Search through this folder to see if there is a network that fits your need.
  2. See http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/ for creating custom network file.
  3. An online GUI tool used to visualize prototxt and generate prototxt for caffe: http://yanglei.me/gen_proto/ (Source code: https://github.com/yl-1993/GenProto/tree/structured)
